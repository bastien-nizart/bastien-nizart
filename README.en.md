## My educational background

After obtaining my General Certificate of Secondary Education in 2018, I headed for a High-School Diploma with mathematics / physics specialties as well as the expert mathematics option that I obtained at the Marguerite Yourcenar polyvalent high school in Beuvry in 2021. 

I am currently a student in computer science at the IUT of Lens, in order to continue in Masterâ€™s degree in computer science, in the specialty that I liked the most during my future training.

## My career

I joined a private security company at the age of 16 to be able to provide them with business administration / management tools. I stayed on permanent contract 4 years in this company (2019-2023).

Since August 2022, I have also launched myself as an auto entrepreneur by creating Admitech. Admitech allows me to meet the expectations of companies of all kinds by offering them turnkey software, tailor-made, and easy to use.

## Associative career 

Since November 2022, I have been involved with AFEV as a mentor. This means that I help, 2 hours a week, a college student with academic difficulties. My missions are not limited to homework help. 

My goal is to guide him towards a good learning method, to guide him in his future educational guidance. But also to make him discover new activities, whether they are sporting, fun, cultural...
